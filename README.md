My name's Zac, and I am a Software Engineer currently living in California.  I have a Masters degree from Carnegie Mellon University in Information Systems Management and a Batchelors in Management Information Systems from the University of Alabama.

# Current Work

## [Cisco Intersight](https://intersight.com)

Currently I am an engineer on the [Cisco Intersight](https://intersight.com) project, where I am a Technical Lead on the Core UI Team.  As a member of the Core UI team, I work with the rest of the team on implementing a solid and consistent User Interface using WebComponents.  My duities also include CDN management, working on various microservices using Docker and Kubernetes, 3rd Party integrations for analytics and error reporting, and whatever else my boss tells me I'm working on and needs to get fixed.

## [YarpBot](https://yarpbot.com)

I am also currently working on [YarpBot](https://yarpbot.com), a Twitch Bot that uses Natural Language Processing to answer common Twitch queries in chat automatically without the need for `!commands`.  Be sure to check it out and provide feedback, even if you just want to yell at me about it and how it got an intent wrong.

I <i>WELCOME</i> it.

## [ShoutBot](https://shoutbot.io)

A project for making a Discord bot that prints text you send it in MUCH LARGER TEXT for REALLY getting Chat's attention.  Cuz YES, this was NEEDED in the world.
